# HTML and CSS Projects

This repository contains two front end web development projects that demonstrate my skills on creating front end projects. 
The two projects are a Space Station site and a Movie Theatre site.

The Space Station:

This is a conceptual site for anyone that would want to book a travel through space. 
It contains multiple features including a navagation bar for easy navigation through the site, image containers showing different locations, and a form for a person who would you want to book an appointment.
I used HTML and CSS to create this site. 

Academy Cinemas:

This is also a conceptual site for someone who would be interested in going to a movie theatre to look at what is showing and knowing what time the movie would be playing. It contains features like a navigation bar and drop down menu for easier access to different parts of the site and cards that display movies and the details about them. I used HTML, CSS, and utilzied Bootstrap to make this website.
